## **ABSTRACT**

This report provides a detailed account of a comprehensive practical engineering project designed to master the end-to-end lifecycle of modern software development. The project involved the design, implementation, and deployment of a full-stack application utilizing a robust tech stack including NestJS for backend services, React for the user interface, and both REST and GraphQL for API communication. Key engineering pillars such as secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), data persistence via Prisma ORM, and performance optimization through Redis caching were implemented to ensure system reliability and scalability.

Furthermore, the project integrated advanced DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows via GitHub Actions. Real-time updates were achieved using GraphQL PubSub, and system responsiveness was enhanced through background job processing. This exercise served to bridge the gap between theoretical software engineering principles and production-ready implementation, resulting in a secure, maintainable, and high-performance digital ecosystem. The report outlines the architectural decisions made, the technical challenges overcome, and the professional engineering workflows adopted during the development process.
